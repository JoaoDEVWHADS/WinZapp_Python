/**
 * WinZapp patch: response contracts for the endpoints the Python client syncs
 * through — list-chats, get-messages, all-contacts and status-session.
 *
 * WHY THESE EXIST AT ALL
 *
 * Everything WhatsApp Web hands back is produced by minified, unversioned
 * third-party code that WinZapp does not control and that changes without
 * notice. When a field it used to return quietly changes shape, nothing here
 * notices: the payload still serialises, still returns 200, and the damage
 * only surfaces far downstream in Python, disguised as something else.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. WhatsApp Web renamed MsgKey's `_serialized` getter
 * to `$1`; WPPConnect's serializer still read `_serialized`, so every message
 * came back with `id: undefined`, JSON.stringify dropped the key entirely,
 * WinZapp normalised the missing id to "" and DatabaseManager discarded 100%
 * of them as id-less. The visible symptom was a chat list with unread counts
 * over a database with zero messages — several steps and one process away from
 * the field that actually broke. See restoreMsgKeySerialized() in
 * util/createSessionUtil.ts, which is the shim that repairs it.
 *
 * WHAT THEY DO, AND DELIBERATELY DO NOT, DO
 *
 * Validation runs in "observe" mode: a payload that does not match is logged
 * and then returned COMPLETELY UNCHANGED. Nothing is rejected, nothing is
 * stripped, no request fails. A WhatsApp Web that starts sending a new field,
 * or an optional one WinZapp has never seen, must never be able to break a
 * running user's sync — this is an accessibility app people depend on daily,
 * and a hard failure here costs far more than a stale field.
 *
 * The value is the log line: it converts "unread counts are wrong and the
 * database is empty" into "list-chats item 0: id — expected string, got
 * undefined", at the exact boundary where the payload entered.
 *
 * Every object schema is `.passthrough()` for the same reason: these describe
 * the minimum WinZapp reads, never the full shape WhatsApp Web sends. Unknown
 * keys are normal and are not a finding.
