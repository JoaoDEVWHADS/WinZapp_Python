"""WhatsApp Web's edit protocol message: recognise it, never store it.

WPP.chat.editMessage() (wa-js) does not only change a message in place. It
also builds a second message — ``type: "protocol"``, ``subtype:
"message_edit"``, a **new id**, ``protocolMessageKey`` naming the original,
``body`` holding the new text — and WhatsApp Web keeps that model in the
chat's message collection, so ``WAPI.getMessages`` returns it alongside the
real messages.

``_normalize_wpp_message()`` had no branch for ``protocol``, so its generic
"unmapped type with body text → conversation" fallback turned it into an
ordinary text message under an id nothing had stored, and every id-based merge
appended it. Reproduced on a real install (2026-09-14): a reply edited at
01:33:26 came back through the live socket under its ORIGINAL id and was
handled correctly; the next periodic get-messages, 43 s later, brought in a
record never seen on the socket — ``conversation``, fromMe, stamped 12 s after
the reply, no quote, text identical to the edited reply. That is the "a few
seconds later a second, unquoted copy appears under it, only on my side".

Cleaning up copies stored before the fix is opportunistic, not a migration:
a stored copy is removed when the edit event behind it is seen again (a sync
or scroll-up that fetches it, or a live re-delivery). The set of seen event ids
lives in memory, so after a restart a chat must be fetched again first, and a
copy whose event has left every window WinZapp fetches stays. On disk it is an
ordinary own ``conversation`` with nothing marking it, so there is no safe way
to find it without the event.

Not proven: why only edits of replies were noticed. The mechanism above does
not depend on the message being a reply, so do not read this module as
confirming that it is limited to them.

**The event is dropped, never applied.** The same edit always reaches Python a
second way that carries the full, current original: wa-js emits
``chat.msg_edited`` on the original model's ``change:latestEditMsgKey`` and
WinZapp re-emits it under the original id (createSessionUtil.ts), which
``_apply_possible_edit()`` already handles — edits made on other devices
included. Applying the protocol event as well would only add ways to be wrong:
stale mentions copied from the stored record, an older edit replayed over a
newer text by a history batch, a deleted chat brought back by an edit of an old
message in it.
