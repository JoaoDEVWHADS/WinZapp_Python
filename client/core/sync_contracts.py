"""Response contracts for the sync endpoints, checked on arrival in Python.

This is the mirror of `client/api_patches/src/dto/sync.ts`. The Node side
observes what it is about to send; this side observes what actually arrived —
and the two are not the same check. Between them sit an HTTP hop, a JSON
round-trip and the `@lid`/phone bridging, so a payload can leave the API valid
and reach here missing the one field the caller needed.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Every consumer in WinZapp reads these payloads with `.get(name, default)`. That
is the right way to survive a chaotic upstream, but it has one cost: a field
that stops arriving is indistinguishable from a field that was never there, and
the code carries on with the default. The failure surfaces much later, wearing
a different face — the canonical case being WhatsApp Web renaming MsgKey's
`_serialized` getter, which arrived here as `id: None`, normalised to `""`, and
made DatabaseManager drop 100% of messages as id-less. Nothing logged anything;
the visible symptom was a chat list with unread counts over an empty database.

WHAT IT DOES, AND DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO

Observation only. `observe_payload()` returns its input **unchanged** and never
raises: nothing is rejected, coerced, filled in or stripped. The single effect
is a `[contract]` line in log.log naming the endpoint and the field. Turning a
mismatch into a failure would let a new optional field from WhatsApp Web break
sync for people who depend on this app daily, which costs far more than the
stale value it would prevent.

Unknown fields are never reported. These contracts describe the minimum WinZapp
reads, never the full shape WhatsApp Web sends — the same reason every schema in
sync.ts is `.passthrough()`.

REPEATS ARE SUPPRESSED

A sync walks thousands of messages. If a field is missing from one it is almost
certainly missing from all of them, so each distinct (endpoint, field, problem)
is logged once per run and counted thereafter — a log the user is expected to
send us must stay readable. `contract_report()` returns the tally.
