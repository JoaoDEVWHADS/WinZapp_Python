"""Issue #71: Windows+NVDA+Left/Right (and reportedly some other NVDA
object-navigation gestures) leaked a literal 'ÿ' (U+00FF) character into
whatever wx.TextCtrl was focused, even though no text key was pressed and the
same gestures type nothing in other applications. ConversationsPanel now
vetoes exactly that character in the message field's EVT_CHAR handler rather
than trying to special-case NVDA's own modifier state, which wx never sees.

ConversationsPanel is a wx.Panel and can't be instantiated without a running
wx.App, so the static veto check is exercised directly against a fake event —
same approach as the rest of this suite for small islands of pure logic.
