"""A delivery-status change must repaint the conversations list.

The chat list's preview line ends with the last message's delivery status —
_last_msg_preview() appends ConversationsPanel._map_status(last) to it. When an
ack arrives, on_message_status_update() records it on the message and refreshes
the open conversation's own row, but it never told the conversations list to
repaint. So a sent message sat on "Pendente" in the list until some unrelated
event (another message landing anywhere, a sync) happened to trigger
set_chats(). Reported live: a chat still reading "Eu: . 21:07 Pendente" a
couple of seconds after the message had visibly been sent.

MainWindow is a wx.Frame and can't be instantiated without a running wx.App, so
the method is bound onto a stub carrying only what it touches — same approach
as the rest of this suite.
