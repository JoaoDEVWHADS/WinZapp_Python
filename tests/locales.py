"""The registered locale set, read once from `languages/language_map.json`.

Not a test module — a helper the locale-parametrized tests derive from, so the
derivation and the check that it produced anything live in one place.

Why derive at all: the set of locales is data, not code. A locale is added by
dropping in `<code>.json` plus an entry in that map, with no rebuild
(CLAUDE.md, "Paths, config, i18n"), so a list written out inside a test goes
stale the moment one is added and silently stops checking it. That already
happened — `pl` was missing from the hand-written lists in test_mute.py and
test_self_reference_label.py, so Polish was never checked by either.

Why the check belongs here rather than in each caller: deriving the list
introduces a second failure mode in exchange. A hand-written list is at least
never empty; a derived one is empty if the map is unreadable in a way json
tolerates (`{}`, or a reshape into a list of objects). Every caller uses it to
drive a loop or a `parametrize`, and an empty sequence makes those pass with
zero iterations — a suite that checks nothing and still goes green, which is
the exact failure the derivation was meant to prevent, moved one level down.

Raising here means a caller cannot obtain the list without the check having
run: it surfaces as a collection error naming this file, before any test in
any of those modules reports success.
