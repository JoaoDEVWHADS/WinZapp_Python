"""Tests for ConversationsPanel._forward_message_to_targets() — forwarding
one message to several picked conversations at once.

Reported live: the forward dialog's conversation picker only ever allowed
selecting one contact at a time (wx.LB_SINGLE), so forwarding to multiple
people meant reopening the dialog and repeating the whole flow once per
recipient. The picker list now allows multi-select (wx.LB_EXTENDED); this
covers the per-target forwarding loop that runs after the dialog closes —
each target is forwarded independently so one bad JID doesn't abort
delivery to the rest, and the caller gets back exactly which targets (by
display name) failed, if any.

The method later grew a `keep_caption` path (forwarding a media message by
re-uploading it through resend_media_message_with_caption instead of
WPPConnect's native forward, which drops the caption) — those cases are
covered separately below.

ConversationsPanel is a wx.Panel and can't be instantiated without a
running wx.App, so the method under test is bound onto a plain stub —
same approach as tests/test_conversation_video_playback.py.
